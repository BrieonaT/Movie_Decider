# Movie_Decider


##Summary and Concept:

The concept for this project is to, at random, choose a movie from a IMDB watch list. The idea behind this is for people such as myself who have a lot of movies on my watch list, yet have trouble picking one to watch. 


##Plan to execute the project:

The plan of execution involves web scraping an inputted URL, gathering up the names of movies from this, arranging them into a list and randomly picking one from there.
